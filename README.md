1. blenderi : For installing Blender
2. blenderu : For updating Blender

## Steps in blenderi
1. Download the tarball of the specified version of Blender
2. Extract tarball to /opt/Blender
3. Delete tarball
4. Create symlinks for blender and blender-thumbnailer binaries
5. Update icon caches with with Blender icons
6. Restart Gnome shell to make Blender appear in the launcher (Works with X11. If you're using Wayland, you'll need to re-login)

## Steps in blenderu
1. Download the tarball of the specified version of Blender
2. Extract tarball to /opt/Blender
3. Delete tarball
4. Update icon caches with with Blender icons
5. Restart Gnome shell to make Blender appear in the launcher (Works with X11. If you're using Wayland, you'll need to re-login)
